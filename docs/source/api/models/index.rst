Models
======

Below is an overview of all the battery models included in PyBaMM.
Each of the pre-built models contains a reference to the paper in which it is derived.

The models can be customised using the ``options`` dictionary defined in the :class:`pybamm.BaseBatteryModel` (which also provides information on which options and models are compatible)
Visit our `examples page <https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/develop/docs/source/examples/notebooks/models>`_
to see how these models can be solved, and compared, using PyBaMM.
